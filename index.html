          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>I'm glad you have found your way to my website. This website was created by me to serve as a way to showcase my life. 
            Initially it was intended to be a portfolio for my engineering resume. But, I always have wanted to publish my thoughts for others to read so I made it a philosophy blog too. This website is a glimpse into my life and into what I find interesting and beautiful. Enjoy.</p>

          <h3>About Me </h3>
          <p>My name is Jacob Pomerantz and I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. Currently, I am a sophomore and I spend my days participating on the Formula team, working in the Ford Manufacturing and Design Center, or working on personal side projects of mine. I am interested in manufacture and design processes which is why I am the team watter-jetter and a shop trainer. </p>
          <p>My current side projects I have build separate from the Formula team include an electric skateboard, as showcased on the left, a halo energy sword, and various circuit python projects.</p>
          <p>In addition, I am from Denver, Colorado, so I have a deep love for the outdoors: all things including hiking, camping, climbing, and skiing especially.</p>
